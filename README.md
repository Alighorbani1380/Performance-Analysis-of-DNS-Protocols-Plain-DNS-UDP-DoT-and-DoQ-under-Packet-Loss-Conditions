# Performance-Analysis-of-DNS-Protocols-Plain-DNS-UDP-DoT-and-DoQ-under-Packet-Loss-Conditions
This repository documents an experimental study comparing the performance of three key DNS protocols: Plain DNS (over UDP), DNS over TLS (DoT), and DNS over QUIC (DoQ). The core of this project was to understand how these protocols behave in terms of speed, reliability, and latency when subjected to various levels of network packet loss.
